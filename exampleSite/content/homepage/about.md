My name is Lesly Bautista, and I graduated from Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos with a degree in geographic engineering. I come from Peru, a country with incredible geographical diversity, and I've always been fascinated by maps' ability to reveal the complexities of our world. This passion has led me to collaborate with prestigious organizations such as the Peruvian Space Agency and the United Nations Development Programme on projects in geovisualization, geospatial database management, and spatial analysis in a variety of settings, from urban to rural.
